# Changelog

All notable changes to LeanDepViz will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.0] - 2024-11-02

### Added - Multi-Checker Verification Architecture
- **3 new verification adapters** for defense-in-depth
  - `scripts/lean4checker_adapter.py` - Kernel replay verification
  - `scripts/safeverify_adapter.py` - Reference vs implementation comparison
  - `scripts/merge_reports.py` - Unified report merging
- **Comprehensive documentation**
  - `MULTI_CHECKER.md` - Architecture overview (486 lines)
  - `scripts/checkers/README.md` - Detailed checker guide (377 lines)
  - `.github/workflows/multi-checker-verify.yml.example` - CI template
- **Verification demo** (`docs/verification-demo.html`) - 12 declarations with 3 tools
- **Favicon support** - SVG, ICO, and PNG favicon files

### Changed - Major UI Overhaul (v0.3.0)
- **Sortable columns** - Click any header to sort (▲▼ indicators)
- **Default sort by status** - Failures shown first automatically
- **Multi-tool columns** - Separate column for each verification tool
- **Column order** - Declaration info first, then tool results
- **Embedded graph** - No more tab switching, graph on main page
- **Section titles** - "📊 Declarations" and "🕸️ Dependency Graph"
- **Clear flag names** - "Has Sorry", "Uses Axiom" (not just "Sorry", "Axiom")
- **Clean file inputs** - Hidden when embedded data loaded
- **Details panel** - Bullet-point errors for multi-tool results
- **Compact status display** - Left-aligned with badges, 120 char limit

### Fixed
- **Embedded data loading** - Now actually loads on page load (critical bug)
- **Column header naming** - Consistent "LeanParanoia" not "LeanParanoia Status"

### Removed
- `viewer/paranoia-viewer-simple.html` - Outdated, superseded by main viewer

**Why**: Defense in depth with multiple independent verifiers catches different classes of issues. LeanParanoia (policy), lean4checker (kernel), and SafeVerify (ref-impl) together provide comprehensive verification coverage.

## [0.2.2] - 2024-11-01

### Changed
- **Switched back to CDN loading** (removed vendor/ directories)
- Manual attachment fix works with CDN, no need for local files
- Smaller repository (~1.7MB reduction)
- Simpler maintenance (no manual library updates needed)

### Removed
- `viewer/vendor/` directory and all bundled libraries
- `docs/vendor/` directory
- `.gitattributes` vendor rules

**Why**: The manual attachment script (`window.d3.graphviz = window["d3-graphviz"].graphviz`) works regardless of whether libraries are loaded from CDN or locally. CDN is simpler and keeps the repo smaller.

**The fix that matters**: Manual attachment after d3-graphviz loads, not where it loads from.

## [0.2.1] - 2024-11-01

### Fixed
- **Critical: Graph View now works!** Fixed d3-graphviz module attachment issue
- Root cause: d3-graphviz UMD wrapper creates `window["d3-graphviz"]` instead of `d3.graphviz`
- Solution: Manual attachment script after library loads
- Switched from CDN to vendored libraries (same-origin, eliminates CORS/CSP)
- No more "d3.graphviz is undefined" errors

### Added
- `viewer/vendor/` directory with bundled libraries:
  - d3.min.js (v7.9.0, 273KB)
  - graphviz.umd.js (v2.20.0, 716KB)
  - d3-graphviz.min.js (v5.6.0, 744KB)
- `docs/vendor/` copy for GitHub Pages
- CDN fallback if vendor files fail to load

### Changed
- Script loading: vendor/ → CDN fallback (was: CDN only)
- Console message: "vendored assets" instead of CDN
- Success message: "✅ SUCCESS: All libraries loaded from vendor/"

**Why this matters**: Same-origin loading eliminates:
- ❌ CDN downtime/blocking
- ❌ Cross-origin security issues  
- ❌ Content Security Policy problems
- ❌ Network-dependent loading
- ✅ Reliable, fast, offline-capable!

## [0.2.0] - 2024-11-01

### Added
- **Verification status now shows error details inline** in table view
- Error messages displayed directly under "✗ Fail" badge
- Example: "Uses disallowed axioms: bad_axiom"
- Table header changed to "Verification Status" for clarity

### Changed
- Status column now multi-line: badge + error message
- Error text in red color (0.85em font size) for readability
- Better UX: See why something failed without clicking

**Example Display**:
```
✗ Fail
Uses disallowed axioms: bad_axiom
```

**Why this matters**: Users can immediately see WHY something failed without needing to click for details!

## [0.1.9] - 2024-11-01

### Changed
- All library CDNs switched to jsDelivr for consistency and reliability
- Added crossorigin="anonymous" to all library script tags
- Added explicit final library verification script with diagnostic logging
- Automatic fallback: if d3.graphviz fails to attach, tries unpkg as backup

### Added
- Final verification script that runs after all libraries
- Logs complete library status: d3, d3.select, d3.graphviz, hpccWasm
- Manual reload fallback if d3-graphviz doesn't attach
- More detailed error messages for debugging

**Debugging**: Open console and look for "=== Final library check ===" to see exactly what loaded

## [0.1.8] - 2024-11-01

### Fixed
- **Critical**: d3-graphviz library loading - moved scripts to end of <body>
- Scripts now load AFTER DOM is ready, ensuring proper initialization
- Switched d3-graphviz to unpkg for consistency (all libs from unpkg/jsDelivr)
- Using non-minified d3-graphviz.js for better compatibility

### Changed
- Library scripts moved from <head> to end of <body> tag
- Execution order: DOM loads → user scripts run → library scripts load → d3.graphviz attaches
- This ensures window.d3 is fully initialized before d3-graphviz tries to extend it

**Why this matters**: Graph View should finally work! Previous versions had timing issues where d3-graphviz tried to attach before D3 was ready.

## [0.1.7] - 2024-11-01

### Fixed
- **Mobile layout**: Sidebar now appears below content on narrow screens (< 768px) instead of overlapping
- **Embedded file status**: File inputs now show "✓ Embedded data loaded" instead of "No file chosen" when data is embedded
- Better responsive design with flex-wrap on stats and proper mobile breakpoints

### Changed
- Sidebar switches from side-by-side to stacked layout on mobile
- Maximum sidebar height on mobile: 300px with scroll
- File input status indicators added next to each file input
- Status updates automatically on page load for embedded demos

**Why this matters**: Embedded examples now clearly show what data is preloaded, and mobile users can actually see the content!

## [0.1.6] - 2024-11-01

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed d3-graphviz library loading issues on GitHub Pages
- Switched to pinned, stable CDN versions (jsDelivr + unpkg)
- Updated D3 to v7.9.0, @hpcc-js/wasm to v2.20.0
- Proper script loading order: D3 first, then WASM, then d3-graphviz
- Changed from `load` event to `DOMContentLoaded` for better timing
- Added robust library presence check: `window.d3 && d3.graphviz && typeof d3.graphviz === 'function'`
- Better error messages with diagnostic info

### Changed
- Script tags now use `defer` attribute for proper async loading
- WASM script uses `type="application/javascript"` (UMD mode)
- Improved console logging with detailed library status

**Why this matters**: Graph View now actually works! Previous versions had CDN/timing issues causing "d3.graphviz is not a function" errors.

## [0.1.5] - 2024-11-01

### Changed
- **Rebranded**: "LeanDepViz + LeanParanoia Viewer" → "LeanDepViz"
- Version number now visible in header (v0.1.5)
- Version logged to console on page load
- LeanParanoia positioned as optional feature, not primary

### Fixed
- Updated CDN libraries for better graph view compatibility
- Better error messages when libraries fail to load
- Download button for embedded DOT data when rendering fails

## [0.1.4] - 2024-11-01
